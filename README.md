# 💫 About Me:
I am a junior Computer Science student at Georgia State University with a 4.0 GPA, skilled in Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. I have experience working with cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure, and have completed projects in game development and data analysis. As a STEM tutor, I’ve strengthened my problem-solving and communication skills. I’m actively seeking internship opportunities to apply my technical knowledge and grow as a software developer.
